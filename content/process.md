# Team Process

Since we like to describe ourselves as a _tactical_ team of engineers, we try to keep our processes as minimal as possible.

## Meetings

The only recurring meeting that we maintain at the moment is the daily standup meeting, where the whole team meets to discuss what they did within the last day, what their blockers are and what they plan on doing during the next day.

When the needs arise, the team can also decide to organize a backlog refinement to go through the issues of a project, prioritize them, refine them, remove outdated ones and create missing ones.

## Communication

There are currently two channels of communication, each with its specific purpose.

* GitHub Issues and Pull Requests should contain all discussions about design where we want to reach a decision. This makes those discussions searchable and directly a part of the repository itself.
* All other written communication should be on Slack, where each project has a dedicated channel, and there is a general channel for matters related to Optakt itself.
