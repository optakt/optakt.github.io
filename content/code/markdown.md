# Markdown Style Guidelines

## General

* Always keep the scope of the document in mind. A document should precisely fulfill its purpose, nothing more, nothing less.
  It is a common pitfall to end up going into rabbit holes and spending half a document explaining irrelevant details.
* Try to write short sentences whenever possible to avoid complex grammar, complex use of tenses, ambiguous pronouns and so on.
  A good guideline when it comes to technical writing is to aim for 20-30 words per sentence.
  Keeping sentences short should however never come at the expense of clarity, syntactic cues and important information.
* Just like in code, consistency is key.

### Sections

* Section titles should follow the [Chicago Title Capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case#Chicago_Manual_of_Style) standard.
* Documents should start with a level one heading and should ideally be the same as the file name.
* Sections should be ordered hierarchically. Each document starts with a level one heading (`#`), which can contain one or more level two headings (`##`), which can contain one or more level threes (`###`) and so on.

### Formatting

* Lists should use the `*` character rather than the `-` character.
* Keep extra newlines between paragraphs and sections to make the source easier to read.
* Paragraphs that include multiple sentences should have the sentences on separate lines, so that updating one sentence results in a clear diff where one line changes.
* For long files that are not served within this repository, it is best to have a table of contents at the end of the introduction of the level one heading section.
* Always specify the language for code blocks so that neither the syntax highlighter nor the text editor must guess.
  If no specific type makes sense, just use `text`.

### Technical Writing

* Use American English (`organize` instead of `organise`, `behavior` instead of `behaviour`, etc.)
* Do not use gendered pronouns when talking about users/consumers/whatever but always `they/their` instead.
* Do not use the future tense but use present simple for expressing general truths instead.
* Use active voice when there is no specific need to use passive.
* Abbreviations and acronyms should be spelled out the first time they appear in any technical document with the shortened form appearing in parentheses immediately after the term.
  The abbreviation or acronym can then be used throughout the document.
* Avoid ambiguous and abstract language (i.e. really, quite, very), imprecise or subjective terms (i.e. fast, slow, tall, small) and words that have no precise meaning (i.e. bit, thing, stuff).
* Avoid contractions (i.e. don't, you'll, etc.) as they are meant for informal contexts.
* Avoid generalized statements, because they are difficult to substantiate and too broad to be supported.
* Avoid story-telling, remain factual and concise.
* Avoid jargon and humor.
* Avoid em-dashes. Putting non-restrictive relative clauses into separate sentences leads to simpler, clearer writing.
  If em-dashes are needed, make sure to use the right character: `â€”` (alt code: `ALT+0151`).
* When referring to something in a certain way (i.e. `FBAS` for _Federated Byzantine Agreement System_) make sure to consistently use only FBAS consistently after the term is introduced.

### Links

* Use informative link titles. For example, instead of naming your links "link" or "here", wrap part of the sentence that is meant to be linked as a title.
* Links to external sources should be:
    * Clear, concise, factual (not tips & tricks-type articles, or blog posts)
    * Reliable to stand the test of time (will not start to 404 because it's a personal blog and the person decided to get rid of it for example)
    * From reliable sources (this is where Wikipedia isn't always perfect, but fine for technical subjects)
* Whenever possible, use internal links instead of external ones (if something has been described in our documents somewhere, link to it instead of externally)

## Specific to this Repository

In this repository, Markdown is extended by some mkdocs plugins which allow you to include external files within a markdown files, and to insert admonitions.

[Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#usage) are a way to include side content into a page without significantly interrupting the document flow.
There are different types of admonitions, and they allow for the inclusion and nesting of arbitrary content.

Including external files can be done by writing the name of a file present in the `include` directory surrounded by `{`/`}` and exclamation marks on an empty line.
