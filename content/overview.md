# Overview

## Introduction

This documentation represents the main knowledge base of the Optakt team outside of the project repositories themselves. It serves as a single place to introduce new engineers to Optakt, to share knowledge between team members and to improve our processes on a continuous basis.

## Structure

The documention website is divided into three major sections:

1. Code talks about everything related to writing code, from design principles, over style guidelines, to useful guides on various topics such as testing.
2. Process is all about how the team organizes its work and how tools from Git, to CI/CD pipelines, should be used.
3. Projects puts together the knowledge about various projects that we have collected over time to provide the necessary background to work on them.
