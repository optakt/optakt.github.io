## Optakt

[Optakt](https://github.com/optakt) is a tactical team of engineers working on projects which reshape the landscape of blockchain technology.
Given the enormous scope and the potential economic throughput of blockchain networks, maintaining high-quality standards for software is paramount.
Our team delivers on this through a single-minded focus on good software design, rather than utilizing the brute-force efforts of larger teams.
