# Projects

TODO: Explain what is the minimal documentation required for any Optakt project.
TODO: Explain what how we handle CI and releases with GitHub Actions.

## Git Workflow

TODO: Explain how we work with branches and why. Mention feature branches for big features.
TODO: Explain that each PR has to be related to one issue.
TODO: Explain PR requirements (labels, squash merges only, CI should pass, one approval at least, etc.)
TODO: Explain that a PR should be blocked by a reviewer only if the reviewer does not want something in the PR to get merged as is. Feedback can be given without blocking the PR.
TODO: Explain that any TODO in the code has to be related to one issue (which can be an external one).
TODO: Explain that any FIXME in the code must be fixed before the PR that adds it can be merged.
TODO: Explain that any generated code has to be generated using a `go generate` target and not a Makefile or equivalent.
